# LedMagic8Ball
##An LED version of the classic magic 8 ball.

Questions and decisions suck, that's why there are magic 8 balls. 
But I found they have a disturbing lack of light emission, so I made an LED version.
When you press a button, the led will flicker in a lot of colors. And when you let go it shows your result.
Red means no, green means yes and blue means maybe.
